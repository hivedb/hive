# What are boxes?

All data stored in Hive is organized in boxes. A box can be compared to a table in SQL but it does not have a structure and can contain anything.

For a small app, a single box might be enough. For more advanced problems, boxes are a great way to organize your data.
Boxes can also be encrypted to store sensitive data.

## Open Box

Before a box can be used, you have to open it:

```dart
var box = await Hive.box('testBox');
```

If the box is already open, it will be returned immediately. All supplied parameters will be ignored.

Once you obtained a box instance, you can read, write and delete entries.

## Get open box

Hive stores a reference to all open boxes. If you want to get an already opened box, you can use 

```dart
var box = Hive['myBox'];
```

This is especially useful for Flutter apps because you don't need a `FutureBuilder` to get a box.

## Close box

If you don't need a box again, you should close it. All cached keys and values of the box will be dropped from memory and the box file will be closed after all active read and write operations finished.

It is not recommended to open and close the same box frequently because this leads to unnecessary disk accesses. If you need a box again in the future, just leave it open.

```dart
var box = await Hive.open('myBox');
await box.put('hello', 'world');
await box.close();
```

Before your application exits, you should call `Hive.close()` to close all open boxes.

Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value database written in pure Dart. Inspired by [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask).

## Features

### Cross-platform ‚ö°
- Runs on desktop, mobile & in browser
- Very good performance (see [benchmark](#benchmark))

### Easy to use ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Keys are of type String or Uint32 and values are arbitrary objects
- The basic operations are `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `delete(key)`
- Strong encryption built in

### Lightweight üéà
- Small runtime
- Small disk space consumption
- **NO** native dependencies

| SharedPreferences is on par with Hive when it comes to read performance. SQLite performs much worse. | Hive greatly outperforms SQLite and SharedPreferences when it comes to writing or deleting. |

This benchmark was performed on a Oneplus 6T with Android Q. All entries are read and written one after another. You can [run the benchmark yourself](https://github.com/hivedb/hive_benchmark).

## Add Hive to project
Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`. Use the latest version instead of `[version]`.

[![Core version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hive?label=hive)](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) [![Generator version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hive_generator.svg?label=hive_generator)](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_generator) [![Build runner version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/build_runner.svg?label=build_runner)](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner)

```yaml
dependencies:
  hive: ^[version]

dev_dependencies:
  hive_generator: ^[version]
  build_runner: ^[version]
```

## Hive ‚ù§Ô∏è Flutter

### Getting started
To get started using Hive in a Flutter project add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`. Use the latest version instead of `[version]`.

[![Core version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hive?label=hive)](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) [![Generator version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hive_generator.svg?label=hive_generator)](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_generator) [![Build runner version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/build_runner.svg?label=build_runner)](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) [![Hive Flutter version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hive?label=hive)](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter)

```yaml
dependencies:
  hive: ^[version]
  hive_flutter: ^[version]

dev_dependencies:
  hive_generator: ^[version]
  build_runner: ^[version]
```

### Example in Flutter
Hive was written with Flutter in mind. It is a perfect fit if you need a lightweight datastore for your app. Here is a sample how that may look like:

```dart
class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WatchBoxBuilder(
      box: Hive.box('settings');
      builder: (context, box) {
        return Switch(
          value: box.get('darkMode'),
          onChanged: (val) {
            box.put('darkMode', val);
          }
        )
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Boxes are cached and therefore fast enough to be used directly in the `build()` method of Flutter widgets.

## Todo

The work on Hive has just started. If you want to contribute, it would be amazing if you helped me with one of these:

- [x] Good test coverage
- [x] Many examples, especially for Flutter
- [x] Benchmarks and comparison
- [x] Finalize API
- [x] Even more tests
- [ ] Queries
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Write binary format spec
- [ ] You can never have enough tests

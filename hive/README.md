Hive is a lightweight and blazing fast key-value store written in pure Dart. Inspired by [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask).

## Features

### Blazing Fast ‚ö°
- More than twice the speed of other datastores
- Binary data format

### Simple to use ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Supports all types
- Strong encryption built in
- Runs on desktop, mobile & in browser

### Lightweight üéà
- Small runtime
- **NO** native dependencies


## Getting Started

### Initialize

Hive needs a directory where it can store its data. Call `Hive.init()` the first time you use Hive.

```dart
Hive.init('path/to/hive');
```

In the browser you don't have to call `init()`.

### Open a Box

All of your data is stored in boxes.

```dart
var box = await Hive.openBox('testBox');
```

Just provide an `encryptionKey` to encrypt a box:

```dart
var key = Hive.generateSecureKey();
var box = await Hive.openBox('secureBox', encryptionKey: key);
```

### Read & Write

Hive supports all primitive types, `List`, `Map`, `DateTime` and `Uint8List`. Any object can be can stored using [TypeAdapters](https://leisim.github.io/hive/#/generate_adapter)

```dart
var dog = Dog(name: 'Nero', age: 4);

box.put('myDog', dog);

Dog myDog = box.get('myDog');
```

## Hive ‚ù§Ô∏è Flutter

Hive was written with Flutter in mind. It is a perfect fit if you need a lightweight datastore for your app. Here is a sample how that may look like:

```dart
class SettingsPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var box = Hive.box('settings');

    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        SwitchListTile(
          value: box.get('darkMode'),
          title: Text("Dark Mode"),
          onChanged: (value) {
            box.put('darkMode', value);
            setState(() {});
          },
        ),
        SwitchListTile(
          value: box.get('pushMessages'),
          title: Text('Send push messages'),
          onChanged: (value) {
            box.put('pushMessages', value);
            setState(() {});
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

Boxes are cached and therefore fast enough to be used directly in the `build()` method of Flutter widgets.

## Todo

The work on Hive has just started. If you want to contribute, it would be amazing if you helped me with one of these:

- [x] Good test coverage
- [ ] Many examples, especially for Flutter
- [ ] Finalize API
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Write binary format spec
- [ ] Even more tests
- [ ] Benchmarks and comparison
